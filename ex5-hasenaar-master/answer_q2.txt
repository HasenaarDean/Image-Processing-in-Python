Q2:

suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
could be used for super-resolution. 

Answer to Q2: 

I'd suggest a neural network trained on a new set of pictures a and b, when a is a picture with 
low resolution and b is a picture with high resolution. It'd learn in which way to improve the 
resolution by using the database. I will also add a corruption function that subsamples the image 
pixels in order to reduce the resolution.
