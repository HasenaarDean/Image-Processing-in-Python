Q1:

Describe the effect of increasing the residual blocks on its performance for each task, both 
quantitatively in terms of the plot you got and qualitatively in terms of the differences in the 
image outputs of each model.

Answer to Q1: 

I noticed that there was a strong descent in the error for both the deblurring and denoising 
for each run while increasing the residual blocks, but also the runtime increased significantly, 
because there were more parameters for the network to learn. Also the quality increased 
significantly every run, and the image became much cleaner for every run. 
However, the network might overfit the data, after a certain threshold.
