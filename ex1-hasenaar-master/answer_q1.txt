Q1:

The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z. 
If a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash. 

Answer to Q1: 

In that case, the program crashes, due to a division by zero error, because when we calculate 
the value of q of a segment that has no pixels at all, we get that the sum of all pixels in this 
segment (i.e. the histogram value), which is our denominator, will be equal to zero, 
according to the algorithm of quantization we learned in class.
