Q2:

Explain the differences between resize_spectrogram and resize_vocoder outputs after recording 
yourself. 

Answer to Q2: 

the differences between resize_spectrogram and resize_vocoder outputs are due to this: in the 
function resize_spectrogram, we used spectrogram scaling with no any phase correction - and thus 
the record isn't clear: the waves do not appear in their right place, and might cancel each other.
Whereas, we do not have this problem in the function resize_vocoder, because the phases are 
adjusted, and as a result the record is clear.
