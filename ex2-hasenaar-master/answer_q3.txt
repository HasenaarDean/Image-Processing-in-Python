Q3:

Why did you get two different magnitude images in conv_der and fourier_der?

Answer to Q3: 

We got two different magnitude images because both of these derivation methods give only a 
proximity of the (discrete) derivative of the image. In the function conv_der we calculate the 
average of the neighbors, whereas in the function fourier_der we take into account all the pixels 
in the same column or row, for each calculation.
