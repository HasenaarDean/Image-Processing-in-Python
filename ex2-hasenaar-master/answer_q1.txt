Q1:

Can you explain the reason for the difference between change_rate.wav and change samples.wav?

Answer to Q1: 

The difference between the two WAV files is due to this: in the function change_rate we speed up 
the WAV by altering the sample rate to be higher, while in the function change_samples we remove 
the higher frequencies by having less sample points. The change_sample function altered the duration 
of the WAV file by reducing the number of samples using Discrete Fourier Transform. Whereas, 
change_rate alters the duration of the WAV file by saving the same samples, while changing the
sample rate. As a result, there is a higher pitch sound in the output of the function change_rate.
