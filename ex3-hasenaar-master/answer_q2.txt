Q2:

What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when: 

Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...)? 

Answer to Q2: 

The result blending picture will be brighter and sharper, because as filter_size_im get larger, the pixels will 
be less precise, because we enlarge the filter vector in the creation of the laplacian pyramid.
