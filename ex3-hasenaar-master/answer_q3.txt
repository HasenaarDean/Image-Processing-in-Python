Q3:

What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when: 

Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels (max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...)? 

Answer to Q3: 

The result blending will be smoother, as long as we take bigger and bigger levels. 
This is because as we take more and more levels in the algorithm of blending, the space around the 
edges of the pictures will be raised. So, it will be more difficult for the cut to be observed.
